This project strategically focuses on refining the multiple-choice question (MCQ) generation process through the utilization of state-of-the-art natural language processing models. 
Specifically, the project leverages BERT for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and employs the T5 Transformer for precise question synthesis. 
Word Sense Disambiguation holds paramount importance in accurately discerning word meanings within contextual nuances, and the incorporation of BERT's contextualized embeddings enhances the granularity of this disambiguation process.
The T5 Transformer, recognized for its efficacy in sequence-to-sequence tasks, is strategically applied to generate MCQs of exceptional quality, drawing upon the content meticulously disambiguated by BERT. 
This integrated approach ensures that the generated questions not only exhibit linguistic accuracy but also resonate with contextual relevance.
Integral components of this project include the meticulous implementation and fine-tuning of these advanced models, systematic experimentation with diverse configurations, and a comprehensive performance evaluation against conventional MCQ generation methodologies. 
The synthesis of BERT and T5 Transformer is designed to significantly amplify the efficiency and efficacy of MCQ generation, with a specific focus on applications within educational and assessment domains.
